            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
            Hello, my name is Viviana Alba and I am a Web Developer and aspiring computational nueroscientist. Throughout my life, 
            I have had a deep fascination for the brain. From learning what neurons are in high school, to exploring the brain's 
            unique relationship with the body during my first nueroscience class in college, the more knowledge I held about the 
            brain, the more I was eager to explore its mysteries. <br> <br>
            I am especially interested in computationl nueroscience, due to the growing leverage that technology has on our 
            society. Everyday, we hear about exciting advancements such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and even
            algorithms that can precisely place an ad for something we have been thinking about at the perfect time. However, I
            am driven to expand the field of technology by using it to explore some of today's most puzzling questions in biology, 
            such as.... <br> <br>
            <text-indent> What is consciousness? <br> </text-indent>
            <text-indent>Is it possible to complete physical tasks through the power of thought? <br> </text-indent>
            <text-indent>How can we affectivley treat addiction and other mental health disorders with a 100% sucess rate? <br> <br> </text-indent>
            Although these questions seem quite impossible to even have an answer for at this time, my hope is to get closer and 
            closer to these answers through research, innovation, and teamwork. Come join me as I continue my journey to explore 
            the fascinating mysteries and powers of the 3 pounds of tissue right in between our ears!
